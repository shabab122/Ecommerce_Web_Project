# Norda v2 — API Reference

Base path: `/api`. JSON is used unless the endpoint is marked multipart or CSV.

Authentication accepts the `norda_token` HTTP-only cookie. Optional development clients can send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` only when `AUTH_RETURN_TOKEN=true`. `Customer` means any authenticated user; `Admin` means an authenticated user with `role: "admin"`.

## Common behavior

Successful endpoints return JSON and an appropriate 2xx status. Errors use:

```json
{ "message": "Human-readable explanation" }
```

Typical codes: `400` invalid input, `401` missing/invalid session, `403` wrong role/owner, `404` missing record, `409` state or uniqueness conflict, `429` rate limit, `502` gateway failure and `503` unavailable configuration.
