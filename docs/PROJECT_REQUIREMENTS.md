# Norda v2 — Project Requirements

## 1. Document control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Product | Norda e-commerce website |
| Version | 2.0.0 |
| Delivery branch | `feature/v2-complete-commerce-flow` |
| Baseline commit | `8d913fa` — Basic foundation of Frontend & Backend |
| Intended market | Bangladesh |
| Currency | BDT |
| Status | Implemented baseline; environment acceptance testing required before release |

This document converts the three supplied flow sketches into explicit, testable requirements. Requirement IDs are stable references for issues, commits and acceptance results.

## 2. Product goal

Norda shall provide a clear end-to-end shopping experience and a small operational workspace. A customer can discover a product, create an account, maintain delivery details, purchase from a server-validated cart, receive an invoice, track payment and fulfillment, and review a delivered item. An administrator can prepare the catalog, process or cancel orders, observe store activity and export operational data.

## 3. Actors and permissions

| Actor | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| Visitor | Browse, search and filter the public catalog; view products and reviews; register or sign in |
| Customer | Visitor capabilities plus profile, cart, checkout, own orders, own invoices and delivered-purchase reviews |
| Administrator | Catalog/media management, all-order processing, invoices, dashboard and CSV reporting |
| SSLCOMMERZ | Hosted payment selection and result notifications; the server validates successful transactions |

An administrator is stored as a user with `role: "admin"`, rather than in a separate credentials collection. This keeps one authentication path and prevents customer/admin account logic from diverging.

## 4. Functional requirements

- **AUTH-02** Email addresses shall be unique and normalized to lowercase.

- **TOTAL-02** Default delivery shall be ৳120 below a ৳5,000 subtotal and free at or above ৳5,000. Both values shall be configurable on the server.
- **TOTAL-03** Currency shall be BDT.

### 4.5 Checkout, stock and invoices

- **ORDER-01** Checkout shall require an authenticated customer, non-empty cart and complete valid shipping address.

- **ORDER-04** If order or invoice creation fails, stock already reserved by that attempt shall be rolled back.
- **ORDER-05** A successful checkout shall create an order, create exactly one invoice, save the delivery profile and clear the cart.

## 6. Source-diagram traceability and design decisions

| Supplied concept | v2 implementation |
|---|---|
| Admin login → upload media → category and brand → product | Admin role, upload endpoint/metadata, category and brand CRUD, product editor |
| Customer browse → login/register → cart → profile → invoice → gateway | Storefront filters, shared auth, persistent cart, saved address, order/invoice service, SSLCOMMERZ module |
| Payment success → paid → delivered → review | Validated callback marks paid; admin transition to delivery; delivered-purchase review gate |
| Payment failed → unpaid → admin cancel/restock | Failed payment remains on unpaid order; cancel transition restores inventory once |
| Dashboard and CSV | Aggregated overview plus protected CSV endpoint |
| `admins` collection | Represented by `users.role`, avoiding duplicate identity storage |
| `invoiceproducts` collection | Embedded immutable invoice line items, appropriate to an order-owned MongoDB snapshot |
| Route → auth → controller → MongoDB | Express router, JWT middleware, controller/service layers and Mongoose models |

## 7. Scope boundaries

Included: physical-product catalog, one currency, flat/free delivery rule, one shipping address per order, COD, SSLCOMMERZ hosted checkout, manual fulfillment, invoice history, verified reviews, local uploads and CSV reporting.

Deferred: coupons, tax engine, variants/SKUs, wish lists, returns portal, gateway refunds, split shipments, multiple warehouses, customer deletion, email/SMS, accounting integration, cloud media storage, recommendation engine, translations, multiple currencies and marketplace sellers.

## 8. Release acceptance summary

The release candidate is acceptable when:

1. All automated tests pass on the target Node version.
2. A clean database can be seeded without a hardcoded password.
3. The complete COD flow passes, including delivery, invoice and verified review.
4. The SSLCOMMERZ sandbox success, failure, cancellation and IPN cases pass with a public callback URL.
5. Concurrent stock checks do not permit inventory below zero.
6. Cancelling an eligible unpaid order restores stock exactly once.
7. Customer A cannot read Customer B’s order or invoice.
8. A non-admin cannot use any management or report endpoint.
9. CSV opens correctly and formula-like customer values remain inert.
10. Responsive, keyboard and print checks in `TESTING_GUIDE.md` pass.

Detailed execution steps are in [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md).
