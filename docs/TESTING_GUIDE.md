# Norda v2 — Testing and Release Guide

## Automated checks

From `server/`:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

The unit suite covers calculation and free-delivery thresholds, shipping validation, allowed order transitions, CSV quoting/formula protection, SSLCOMMERZ result matching and safe gateway hosts, and shared validation helpers.

Syntax-check all JavaScript:

```bash
find . ../client -type f -name '*.js' -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -print0 \
  | xargs -0 -n1 node --check
```

## Clean local environment

1. Start a dedicated non-production MongoDB database.
2. Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env`.
3. Generate a new JWT secret and choose a seed admin password of 12 or more characters.
4. Keep `SSLCOMMERZ_IS_LIVE=false`.
5. Run `npm run seed`, then `npm run dev`.
6. Open `http://localhost:5000` rather than opening the HTML file directly.

## Core acceptance matrix

| ID | Scenario | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| A01 | Register with valid name/email/8+ password | Account created; cookie set; user enters storefront |
| A02 | Register duplicate email | Clear 400 error; no second user |
| A03 | Put external URL in `next` login query | Redirect falls back to Norda home |
| C01 | Filter by category, brand and BDT price | URL and result chips reflect filters; results match |
| C02 | Search text containing regex characters | Treated literally; API remains responsive |
| C03 | Add quantity above stock | 409 response; cart/stock unchanged |
| O01 | COD checkout | Stock decreases; order and one invoice created; profile saved; cart cleared |
| O02 | Edit a product price after O01 | Existing order/invoice totals remain unchanged |
| O03 | Cancel eligible unpaid order twice | First request restores exact quantity; second does not add stock again |
| O04 | Move pending directly to shipped | 409 conflict |
| O04A | Advance unpaid online order to processing | 409 conflict; cancellation remains available |
| O05 | Deliver COD order | Fulfillment is delivered; payment and invoice are paid |
| I01 | Customer A requests Customer B invoice | 403 response |
| R01 | Review before delivery | 403 response |
| R02 | Review after delivered purchase | Review saved as verified; product aggregate updates |
| M01 | Upload valid WebP ≤5 MB as admin | File and metadata created |
| M02 | Upload executable renamed `.jpg` | Rejected by MIME/extension checks |
| X01 | Non-admin requests dashboard/CSV | 403 response |
| X02 | CSV customer value begins `=` | Exported cell starts with apostrophe and cannot execute as formula |

## Manual COD journey

1. Sign in as administrator and create a category and brand.
2. Upload a product image, create a stocked product and make it featured.
3. Open the storefront in a separate browser profile.
4. Register, browse/filter, add the product and change quantity.
5. Complete every delivery field and select cash on delivery.
6. Confirm My Orders shows pending payment, pending fulfillment and an invoice.
7. In admin, advance pending → processing → shipped → delivered.
8. Confirm COD payment and the invoice are paid.
9. As the customer, submit a review and confirm it displays as verified.

## SSLCOMMERZ sandbox acceptance

Requirements: sandbox credentials, HTTPS `SERVER_URL`, HTTPS `CLIENT_APP_URL`, and a public callback/IPN route.

1. Confirm `/api/payments/config` reports enabled and `sandbox`.
2. Complete checkout with online payment and verify the browser is redirected only to an HTTPS SSLCOMMERZ host.
3. Complete a successful sandbox payment. Confirm one payment record is paid, its transaction/amount/currency match, the order is paid and processing, and the invoice is paid.
4. Replay the success callback/IPN. Confirm totals, stock and paid timestamp are not duplicated.
5. Run a failed payment. Confirm the order remains visible and unpaid with failed payment status.
6. Cancel a hosted payment. Confirm it remains visible and unpaid/cancelled-payment; then administratively cancel the order and verify stock restoration.
7. Alter transaction ID, amount or currency in an isolated test callback fixture. Confirm validation refuses payment.
8. Exercise a high-risk sandbox result if available. Confirm it is not accepted as paid and requires review.

Do not test live payment credentials from a developer machine. Rotate sandbox credentials if they appear in logs or screenshots.

## Browser and responsive checklist

- Current Chrome/Chromium, Firefox and Safari/WebKit equivalents
- 360 px mobile, 768 px tablet, 1024 px laptop and 1440 px desktop
- Header menu opens by keyboard and touch; focus remains visible
- Catalog cards do not overflow and filters remain usable
- Cart quantities and checkout labels remain readable at 200% zoom
- Forms expose labels, errors and useful autocomplete values
- Order and payment states have text, not color only
- Invoice prints on A4/Letter without the site header/footer or horizontal clipping
- Hero text remains readable and the decorative image does not hide core actions

## Security release checklist

- Unique 32+ character JWT secret in secret storage
- Seed/admin password changed; no shared demo credentials
- Exact production `CLIENT_URL`; HTTPS on client, API and gateway callback URLs
- `AUTH_RETURN_TOKEN=false` for same-origin deployment
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- MongoDB least-privilege user, network allowlist, backups and restore test
- Gateway live credentials installed only after sandbox sign-off
- Reverse proxy request limits and security headers reviewed
- Upload directory replaced with durable storage and content scanning
- Central logs redact cookies, tokens, credentials and payment payload details
- Monitoring covers 5xx rate, callback failures, unpaid/failed orders, stock anomalies and database health

## Branch and release procedure

1. Work only on `feature/v2-complete-commerce-flow` for this revision.
2. Review `git diff --check`, dependency lockfile, tests and this checklist.
3. Push the feature branch and open a pull request; do not push the revision directly to `main`.
4. Record environment acceptance evidence in the pull request.
5. Merge to `main` only after approval and a rollback plan.
6. Tag the accepted merge (for example `v2.0.0`) and update `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Current test boundary

The repository’s automated suite is deterministic and does not require MongoDB or gateway credentials. Database concurrency, browser end-to-end behavior and real SSLCOMMERZ callbacks must be run in an integration environment before production release.
